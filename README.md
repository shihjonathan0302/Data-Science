## **Final Project**

### **Project Overview**

The final project is a comprehensive data science project that applies all the concepts learned throughout the course. The objective is to use data preprocessing, machine learning, and model evaluation techniques to solve a real-world problem using a dataset of your choice.

### **Project Structure and Tasks**

1. **Problem Definition and Data Collection**  
   - Define the problem you aim to solve and the data required.  
   - Source or create a dataset that fits the problem’s needs.

2. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Clean and preprocess the data by handling missing values, removing outliers, and scaling features.
   - Encode categorical variables and manage imbalanced datasets if necessary.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Perform EDA on the dataset, using visualization tools (e.g., histograms, scatter plots) to uncover insights.
   - Identify trends, relationships, and outliers within the data.

4. **Model Building**  
   - Implement multiple machine learning algorithms (e.g., regression, classification, or clustering models) depending on the problem.  
   - Use both supervised and unsupervised learning techniques as appropriate.

5. **Model Evaluation and Tuning**  
   - Evaluate models using appropriate metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score for classification models; MSE for regression models).
   - Tune the models by adjusting hyperparameters and applying regularization techniques to improve performance.

6. **Conclusion and Reporting**  
   - Summarize the project’s methodology, results, and insights.
   - Discuss the limitations of your models and suggest areas for improvement.
